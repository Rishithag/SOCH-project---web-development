	<h2>PROBLEM STATEMENT</h2>
	<p>In some areas people are suffering with kidney diseases, to overcome this problem is there any preventive measures to adopt before supplying the water to the customer</p>

	<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
	<p>To find the measures that could be taken which could help prevent people from suffering through kidney and other diseases due to improper supply of water to the consumers in many parts of India</p>

	<h2>SOLUTION / APPROACH</h2>
	<p>Our solution to this problem is to build an android app which will tell whether the water is portable or not by means of a sensor(Arduino) which will calculate the toxicity of water ,conductivity of water and according to the data outputs given by the sensor, the app will tell whether the water being supplied is portable or not.

	Our app will provide information of water treatment methods which will be an add on and queries regarding any preventive measure can be known using a chatbot linked with the app database. 
	</p>

	<h2>SOLUTION  IN DETAIL</h2>
	<p>We will create our own conductivity sensor using Arduino which will gather data regarding the pollution levels of the water.</p>
